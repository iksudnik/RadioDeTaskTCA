# SwiftUI & Composable Architecture Version of Radio.de iOS Developer Test Assignment

## Introduction

This repository presents a reimagined version of my test assignment for the iOS developer position at Radio.de, now utilizing SwiftUI and the Composable Architecture (TCA). This modernized approach represents a significant evolution from the original project, which was developed using UIKit. For reference to the original UIKit version of this project, please visit: [RadioDeTask UIKit Version](https://github.com/iksudnik/RadioDeTask).

## Project Overview

Leveraging SwiftUI and TCA, this version aims to demonstrate the application of modern development practices in iOS development, offering a more declarative, efficient, and scalable approach to building complex user interfaces and managing application state.

## Key Technologies

- **SwiftUI**: A framework that enables the building of user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift, using a declarative syntax.
- **Composable Architecture (TCA)**: A library that helps manage application state in a predictable manner, facilitates the handling of side effects, and promotes a modular application structure through unidirectional data flow.

### Features:

- **Declarative UI**: Utilizes SwiftUI for a concise and readable approach to UI development, reducing boilerplate and improving developer productivity.
- **State Management**: Employs TCA for centralized and predictable state management, streamlining the development of feature-rich and complex applications.
- **Functional and Reactive Programming**: Incorporates functional programming principles and reactive patterns, aligning naturally with SwiftUI and TCA to create a more maintainable codebase.
